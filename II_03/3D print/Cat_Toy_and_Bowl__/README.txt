# Summary

A cat toy and bowl made from a 400 electron solution to the Thomson problem.  The electron positions have been connected with a swirl of bonds that make a pseudo three fold axis.  The toy, when printed in PLA on my Replicator, bounces like a rubber ball.  It prints well and is large enough to hold several objects.  The bowl is designed to hold the toy.                                                                        

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerBot
Printer: MakerBot Replicator (5th Generation)
Rafts: Yes
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2 mm
Infill: 50%

Notes: 
The bowl and toy have small flat surfaces as aids for printing.  Nice prints are obtained with a small raft, no support, and 0.2 mm layers. The toy can be filled with a variety of objects.  Pause the printing when it is 60 to 70% complete and carefully add the objects.  A small furry mouse and a few bells make a pleasant sounding toy.
